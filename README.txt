This is my small digital prototype for the Lonely Traveler game.

The game mechanics included as part of the prototype are:

- Change direction of the player (using the arrow keys)
- Move player forward (using the enter key)
- Going from heaven to hell (once the player reaches the highest block)

Other things I tried to incorporate to the prototype:

- Music (one for heaven, one for hell)
- Colors (dependant on the world)
